* Candor

A project lisp created while learning C, it is based off of
the [[https://buildyourownlisp.com][Build Your Own Lisp]]
series. The syntax follows closer to Scheme rather than the
syntax used by BYOL.

** Note

Candor was built as a learning project to get some practical
experience with C rather than reading a bunch of books. This
should not be used as it is rather slow and is missing many
features. Feel free to give critism or feedback on anything
as I'm always learning and happy to learn how I could have
done something better.
