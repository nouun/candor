* Candor

A project lisp created while learning C, it is based off of
the [[https://buildyourownlisp.com][Build Your Own Lisp]]
series. The syntax follows closer to Scheme rather than the
syntax used by BYOL.

** Note

Candor was built as a learning project to get some practical
experience with C rather than reading a bunch of books. This
should not be used as it is rather slow and is missing many
features.
